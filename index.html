		<div class="text">A small garden of living plants reacts to the touch and proximity of a spectator to create an immersive and generative soundscape. Three different kinds of sensors embedded in the soil register changes in the plants’ environment such as the presence of human touch, fluctuations in light, and soil moisture level. Using an Arduino microcontroller, this data from the plants is routed into the audio synthesis environment Max where it is used to control aspects of the sound. Through their observation and interaction, the audience takes part in sculpting a real-time aural representation of the plants’ environment.<br/><br/>Root Note is a physical computing project by <a href="http://nickbratton.com/" target="_blank">Nick Bratton</a> and <a href="http://rebeccalieberman.com/" target="_blank">Rebecca Lieberman</a> made at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" target="_blank">NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program.</a> To get in touch, <a href="mailto:rebeccalieberman@gmail.com,nick.bratton@nyu.edu">email us</a>.</div>
